    He lives in 221B Baker street, London England.
    <p>
    First appearing in print in 1887's A Study in Scarlet, the character's popularity
    became widespread with the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine,
    beginning with "A Scandal in Bohemia" in 1891; additional tales appeared from then until 1927,
    eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories. All but one are set in the Victorian or
    Edwardian eras, between about 1880 and 1914. Most are narrated by the character of Holmes's friend
    and biographer Dr. John H. Watson, who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and
    often shares quarters with him at the address of 221B Baker Street, London, where many of the
    stories begin.
