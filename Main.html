    <img src="photo.jpg" width="450px"><br>

    He lives in 221B Baker street, London England.
    <p>
    First appearing in print in 1887's A Study in Scarlet, the character's popularity
    became widespread with the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine,
    beginning with "A Scandal in Bohemia" in 1891; additional tales appeared from then until 1927,
    eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories. All but one are set in the Victorian or
    Edwardian eras, between about 1880 and 1914. Most are narrated by the character of Holmes's friend
    and biographer Dr. John H. Watson, who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and
    often shares quarters with him at the address of 221B Baker Street, London, where many of the
    stories begin.

    Though not the first fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes is arguably the best known.[1]
    By the 1990s there were already over 25,000 stage adaptations, films, television productions and
    publications featuring the detective,[2] and Guinness World Records lists him as the most portrayed
     literary human character in film and television history.[3] Holmes's popularity and fame are such
     that many have believed him to be not a fictional character but a real individual;[4][5] numerous
     literary and fan societies hagice of fandom.[6] The character and stories have had a profound and
    lasting effect on mystery writing and popular culture as a whole, with the original tales as well
    as thousands written by authors other than Conan Doyle being adapted into stage and radio plays,
    television, films, video games, and other media for over one hundred years.
