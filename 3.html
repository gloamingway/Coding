    Though not the first fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes is arguably the best known.[1]
    By the 1990s there were already over 25,000 stage adaptations, films, television productions and
    publications featuring the detective,[2] and Guinness World Records lists him as the most portrayed
     literary human character in film and television history.[3] Holmes's popularity and fame are such
     that many have believed him to be not a fictional character but a real individual;[4][5] numerous
     literary and fan societies hagice of fandom.[6] The character and stories have had a profound and
    lasting effect on mystery writing and popular culture as a whole, with the original tales as well
    as thousands written by authors other than Conan Doyle being adapted into stage and radio plays,
    television, films, video games, and other media for over one hundred years.
